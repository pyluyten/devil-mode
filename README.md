Long version:

I'm currently hacking on emacs-nu, which is a non modal
global minor mode with common ideas about usability.

I choosed not to delete this repo because evil-mode or
ergoemacs-mode remains interesting foundations to build around.

I looked at the idea to code something usable from
different modes (proof is, onto this even repo, evil-mode bodhi
and bodhi without evil use the same prompts).
But for now this limitation is an issue, prompts are great,
alt key is great, & i need to extend this to get rid
of too much keybinds no one can remember.

Actually the only reason I see is: maybe, while editing
hours & hours a day, having both what is here bodhi mode
and evil-mode to switch from one to another, might
make sense.

But bodhi would need to be the emacs-state, while evil-mode
states should remain untouched. And no reason to work on this now.
